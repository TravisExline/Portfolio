            <p class="about-me-p">After achieving a Bachelors Degree from Loras College in 2017, I entered the work force as a photographer and content creator.
                I have a passion for content creation; Whether in the form of photography, videography, editing, or writing a few lines of code. 
                After some time working on a sales team, I decided to pursue a career change by leaving my job and commiting to Flatiron's online Software Engineering program full time. 
                It was here I began to learn how difficult, rewarding, and entertaining the world of programming was.  I fell in love with writing code and creating something new and never before
                seen from the ground up.  This was my ultimate form of content creation. WOW THAT SUCKS
